Problem Description
Nora's ecosystem of technologies is made up of three main elements: Nora Professional, Nora
App and Noralytics. This technical test describes a small subset of the features and functionality
of Nora Professional.

Therapists, Patients and Centers
The objective of the Nora Professional system is that health professionals, therapists from now
on, can actively monitor the patients discharged after suffering a stroke. The therapists belong
to a single center which is identified by a unique code made up of five alphanumeric characters.
Patients are also assigned to a single center. And also patients are assigned to a therapist.
Patients can only be assigned to a therapist if they belong to the same center.

Surveys:
One of the most used monitoring methods is to carry out surveys to the patients. A survey is
made up of questions which can be of the type Open, Range or Decimal.

- Open-ended questions are answered with free-form text
- Range-type questions are answered with an integer between two values (min and max)
- Decimal questions are answered with an unrestricted decimal number
  Surveys may also contain groups of questions, these receive a name and are composed of a
  series of questions.
  It is of interest to know the numerical value of a whole survey, that is, the sum of the values of
  all the responses. If the question is open type, its value is 0.
  The surveys belong to a single center. The therapist may send surveys to patients when the
  following conditions are met:

- The survey belongs to the same center as the therapist
- The patient belongs to the same center and is assigned to the therapist
